# Space Invasion

__Space Invasion__ is a casual arcade game built using __Phaser3__ (Front End) and __Node.js__ and __Express__ (Back End) and is
hosted on __Azure Cloud__ and we use a __Firebase__ database to store accounts and balances.

We made this game in McHacks, McGill University's Annual 24 hour(almost) Hackathon.
